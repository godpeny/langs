Sue: I can't believe our wedding day is almost here! Have you thought about your vows yet?
Terry: I've been working on them. I want them to be perfect. How about you?
Sue: Same here. I keep rewriting mine. There's so much I want to say.
Terry: I know exactly what you mean. Have you decided on your dress?
Sue: Yes, it's all set. I can't wait for you to see it. What about the suit? Did you pick one?
Terry: I did! Went with a classic black tuxedo. I hope you'll like it.
Sue: I'm sure I'll love it. Have you talked to the band about our song?
Terry: Yes, they confirmed they'll play it. Everything's falling into place.
Sue: That's great to hear. It's going to be such a beautiful day.
Terry: It really will be. I can't wait to marry you.
